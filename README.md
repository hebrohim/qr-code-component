## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

A simple project that helped me relearn the concept of flexbox in css. I learn how to style a child tag from the parent tag

### Continued development

After dsigning this component using css flexBox, i will like to also relearn the concept of css grid and design an application with it 



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with the flexbox attributes. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
